COE 379L Final Project
- compares LSTM neural network predictions with those of standard fully
connected neural networks for predictions of 1 day (with or without sentiment data taken from NewsAPI for the particular stock) or
20 days (with different lookback windows).
  - optionally uses a wavelet function (DMD) to smooth the price data
and decrease prediction error
- optionally uses a Hankel Matrix decomposition
(existing method, different application) and Black Scholes Option price as new features
